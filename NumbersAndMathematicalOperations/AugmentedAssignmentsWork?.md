How Do Augmented Assignments Work?
Augmented assignment combines a binary operation with an assignment in one step. It takes a variable, applies an operation to it with another value, and stores the result back into the same variable.

If you're familiar with a language like JavaScript, you've probably heard of the addition assignment operator (+=) or subtraction assignment (-=), and others. Those exist in Python, too. The only difference is that they're referred to as augmented assignments.

The basic syntax of an augmented assignment looks like this:

Example Code
variable <operator>= value
Which is a more efficient way of doing this:

Example Code
variable = variable <operator> value
For example, here's an example of using augmented assignment to add 5 to an existing variable:

Example Code
my_var = 10
my_var += 5

print(my_var) # 15
And here is the same thing, but without augmented assignment:

Example Code
my_var = 10
my_var = my_var + 5

print(my_var) # 15
The advantage of augmented assignment is that it provides a concise and readable way to update a variable value without repeating the variable name. In turn, this reduces redundancy and potential errors that might arise from a typo or something similar.

Every operator can use an augmented assignment. We've looked at the addition assignment operator (+=), so let's look at others.

The subtraction assignment operator (-=) subtracts the right operand from the left variable and stores the difference in the left variable:
Example Code
count = 14
count -= 3

print(count) # 11
The multiplication assignment operator (*=) multiplies the left variable by the right operand and stores the product back in the left variable:
Example Code
product = 65
product *= 7

print(product) # 455
The division assignment operator (/=) divides the left variable by the right and stores the result back in the left variable:
Example Code
price = 100
price /= 4

print(price) # 25.0
The floor division operator (//=) floor‑divides the left variable by the right and stores the result back in the left variable:
Example Code
total_pages = 23
total_pages //= 5

print(total_pages) # 4
The modulus assignment operator (%=) computes the remainder of the left variable divided by the right and stores it back in the left variable:
Example Code
bits = 35
bits %= 2

print(bits) # 1
The exponentiation assignment operator (**=) raises the left variable to the power of the right and stores the result back in the left variable:
Example Code
power = 2
power **= 3

print(power) # 8
You can use some augmented assignment operators with strings, too. For example, the addition assignment operator makes it easy to concatenate strings:

Example Code
greet = 'Hello'
greet += ' World'

print(greet) # Hello World
And the multiplication assignment operator can be used to repeat a string:

Example Code
greet = 'Hello'
greet *= 3

print(greet) # HelloHelloHello
Other augmented assignments throw a TypeError when you use them with strings:

Example Code
greet = 'Hello'
greet -= ' World'

print(greet) # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'str'


greet = 'Hello'
greet /= 'World'

print(greet) # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /=: 'str' and 'str' 
If you're wondering if increment and decrement operators (++ and  --) work in Python, they don't. That's because Python deliberately avoids C-style increment and decrement shortcuts in order to keep the language clear and explicit.

Instead of x++, you can simply write x += 1, which makes it obvious that you're incrementing the value of x by 1.

Writing ++x in Python just applies the unary plus twice, and does not increment anything:

Example Code
my_var = 5

print(+my_var)   # 5
print(++my_var)  # 5
print(+++my_var) # 5

my_var += 1

print(my_var) # 6

What is the main advantage of using augmented assignment operators?

They provide a concise way to update variables without repeating the variable name.

What happens when you use the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators in Python?

They are interpreted as double unary operators with no actual increment/decrement.

Which augmented assignment operator raises a variable to a power and stores the result back to that variable?
**=
