How Do Functions Work in Python?
Functions are reusable pieces of code that run when you call them. Many programming languages come with built-in functions that make it easier to get started. Python is no exception, and we've already covered some built-in functions like print() in previous lessons.

Another helpful built-in function is input(), which lets you prompt the user for input:

Example Code
name = input('What is your name?') # User types "Kolade" and presses Enter  
print('Hello', name) # Output: Hello Kolade
On the other hand, int() converts a number, boolean, and a numeric string into an integer:

Example Code
print(int(3.14)) # 3
print(int('42')) # 42
print(int(True)) # 1
print(int(False)) # 0 
You can also write your own custom functions. To do that, you use the def keyword, followed by the name you want to give your function, a pair of parentheses, and a colon. Then on a new line, you write the code your function should run. The code the function runs is also referred to as the function's body.

Here's an example of a custom function named hello that prints the string Hello World to the terminal:

Example Code
def hello():
    print('Hello World')
To run the function, you need to call it with its name followed by a pair of parentheses:

Example Code
hello() # Hello World
Notice the indentation before print('Hello World'). As you may recall from previous lessons, Python relies on indentation to determine which groups of statements belong together. These groups of statements are called code blocks.

Here's another simple function that prints the sum of two numbers to the terminal:

Example Code
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)
You can see that our function, calculate_sum, has a and b in its parentheses, separated by a comma. Those are called parameters. Think of parameters as placeholder variables that act as "slots" for the values you pass into functions when you call them.

To use the parameters, you have to pass in "arguments". Arguments are the values you pass to a function when you call it.

Here's how to call the calculate_sum function to sum together the numbers 3 and 1:

Example Code
calculate_sum(3, 1) # 4
If you call the function without the correct number of arguments, you'll get a TypeError:

Example Code
calculate_sum()

# TypeError: calculate_sum() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'a' and 'b'
Functions also use a special return keyword to exit the function and return a value. If you don't explicitly use return, Python will return None by default.

Here's an example:

Example Code
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)

my_sum = calculate_sum(3, 1) # 4
print(my_sum) # None
You can see that the calculate_sum function prints the sum of a and b, but it doesn't return anything explicitly. So when we assign its result to my_sum, the value is actually None. To fix that, you can use the return keyword to send back the result:

Example Code
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

my_sum = calculate_sum(3, 1)
print(my_sum) # 4
Now, calculate_sum returns the sum of a and b, which gets stored in my_sum.
